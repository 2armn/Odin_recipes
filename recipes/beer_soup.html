    <p>Beer soup is a soup which is usually roux-based and made with beer.
       In medieval Europe, it was served as a breakfast soup, sometimes poured 
       over bread.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon: Bacon is optional, but it adds a deep meaty flavor. </li>
        <li>Vegetables: From the vegetable aisle, you’ll need onions, carrots, and celery.  </li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the beer cheese soup with fresh garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and dry mustard.  </li>
        <li>Butter and flour: Make a roux with equal parts butter and all-purpose flour.  </li>
        <li>Beer: It wouldn’t be beer cheese soup without a bottle of beer!  </li>
        <li>Broth: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.  </li>
        <li>Milk: The creamy recipe calls for whole milk, but you can use half-and-half for an even richer soup.  </li>
        <li>Sauces and condiments: Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce take the flavor up a notch. </li>
        <li>Cheese: You’ll need about three cups of sharp Cheddar cheese. </li>
        <li>Popcorn: Popped popcorn makes a fun, tasty topping.  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon (if using), then transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Cook the vegetables in the drippings (if you’re not using bacon, cook them in oil). </li>
        <li>Make a roux, then stir in the beer. Cook until thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in the broth and milk, then bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and continue cooking until thickened.        </li>
        <li> Stir in Dijon, Worcestershire, dry mustard, and hot sauce and remove from heat. </li>
        <li> Add the cheese slowly.</li>
        <li> Serve hot and, if you like, topped with popcorn and bacon.        </li>
    </ol>
